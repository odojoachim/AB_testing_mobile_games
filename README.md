This project uses Kaggle dataset on mobile games app Cookie Cats https://www.kaggle.com/yufengsui/mobile-games-ab-testing?select=cookie_cats.csv with main hypothesis
#### Primary Hypothesis
*H0*: If sum_gamerounds is related to version then by placing the gate at level 40 we will change the average sum_gamerounds.
*HA*: If sum_gamerounds is not related to version then by placing the gate at level 40 we will not change the average sum_gamerounds.  
#### Secondary hypothesis 
*H0*: If retention rate is affected by version of game where gate is placed on different stage, then by placing the gate at level 40 we will change the retention rate. 
*HA*: If retention rate is not affected by the version of game then placing the gate at level 40 will not change the retention rate.
