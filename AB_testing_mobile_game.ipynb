    "AB testing has different applications including optimizing the website or mobile app as well as determining the probability threshold for a second-time conversion rate for example. We can measure after building churn prediction what is the best probability threshold to encourage the user to another contact with the business. However, AB testing cannot tell you if you miss something. It compares old to new design / method / style. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project due to data availability, I will concentrate on introducing a new feature on the website. You will exposure new and existing user to 2 different versions old version, called control group and the new method, called test group and will measure the response from the user. In the current version, we have a gate on level 30 and we want to test if this gate would be good to put on level 40 or keep in the old place - gate 30. \n",

Click through probability - unique visitors who clicked / unique visitors to the page, probability of retention = number of users with retention in day 1 or 7 over the total number of users. This probability assures us that even if the sample size is different this probability is always between 0 and 1 and the binomial distribution of AB testing requires us to compare experiments using probability rather than the count.
